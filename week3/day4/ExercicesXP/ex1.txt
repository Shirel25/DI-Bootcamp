=== Task: Explain why data visualization is important in data analysis. ===

Data visualization make data easier to understand
and interpret. It helps identify patterns, trends, 
and anomalies, making insights more accessible. 
By representing data through graphs, charts, and plots, it enables efficient  
and effective communication of information. 


=== Task: Describe the purpose of a line graph in data visualization. ===

Line plots are used to display quatitative values over a continuous
interval of time span. They are ideal for showing trends and changes
over time.
Data points are plotted and connected by straight 
line segments forming a visual representation of variations. 
Often, the x-axis represents time.
