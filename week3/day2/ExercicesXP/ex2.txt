=== A series of blog posts about travel experiences. ====
    We could extract key information from the text, such as the travel destination, 
    travel date, activities done, total price and general reviews.
    Then, we could store this data in a structured database table, making it easier to
    analyze and work with.

=== Audio recordings of customer service calls. ====
    We could use AI to generate a transcription of the call, then extract key
    information from the text. As in the previous example, we would store the extracted data in a structured database 
    table to facilitate further analysis.

=== Handwritten notes from a brainstorming session. ====
    We could use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to convert handwritten text into digital text.  
    Then, we would extract the key ideas and organize them in a database for easy access and analysis.

=== A video tutorial on cooking. ====
    Similar to audio recordings, we could generate a transcription of the video and extract relevant data, such as 
    ingredients and cooking steps. This structured data could then be sotored in a database for future use.
